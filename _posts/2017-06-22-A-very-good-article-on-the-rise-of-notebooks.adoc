For all those that are interested in "Big Data" *Notebooks*, I recommend the reading of this small article: https://www.datanami.com/2016/05/04/rise-data-science-notebooks/

It briefly explains why they recently became so popular, essentially :

* by facilitating the *direct connections* to all necessary *data sources*
* because the can be *easily shared* and allow *easy collaborative work* (in the same way as a Google Doc)
* by allowing *complex data processing* that can't be performed in SQL

The result of this being that they are progressively *taking of part of the workload usually done by BI tools* (which, in their case, are limited to data sets queryable with SQL)
